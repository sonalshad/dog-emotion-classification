# Dog Emotion Classifier

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and models for a deep learning project aimed at classifying the emotive states of dogs based on their facial expressions captured in video frames. The project utilizes state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (ResNet34, ResNet50) and a Vision Transformer (DINOv2) to analyze and predict the emotive states as either positive (anticipation of a reward) or negative (frustration).

### Objectives
- To evaluate the capability of deep learning models to interpret non-human animal emotions.
- To contribute to the improvement of interspecies communication and enhance understanding of animal emotions.

### Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine:
